This is a Flask-based web application for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The application allows users to upload an X-ray image and receive a classification result: either "Pneumonia" or "Normal".

The Pneumonia Detection AI Web App works by allowing users to upload chest X-ray images, which are processed using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model analyzes the grayscale image, predicts whether it indicates "Pneumonia" or "Normal," and displays the result on the web interface. Additionally, the app provides a preview of the uploaded image alongside the classification outcome. This streamlined process enables efficient and accurate detection of pneumonia in real time.
